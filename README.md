## Overview
Intermediate C++ course at De Anza college, Cupertino, California

* Course builds on basic C++ constructs like classes, methods and member/attributes variables
* Covers OOP techniques like inheritance and polymorphism
* Use of references and pointers at a very high level
* Basic use of vector as a dynamic collection

### Key take aways
The course gave a good overview of some of the important topics in C++. The assignments were repeatative, more variety would have helped gain a better understanding of the concepts.

A good text book to follow along with practice exercises would have helped to reinforce concepts during the course.
